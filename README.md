<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>This is my Seond major project for my full stack development course with the code institute. I am planning on creating a fan page for one of my favourite bands. The reason I chose to do this is I will be interested and intvested in this topic and I believe I can make it work.</p>

<h2>Intitial Ideas</h2>

<p>To start with I had to think how I could implement my new found skills into this project to test me. I will start by building a basic layout for the pages with HTML and CSS. I will only use CSS for static styling on this project and leave the animations and interactive styling to the javascript to process. </p> 
<p>I have thought about various different API's that work with this Idea and the ones I have come up with so far are going to be listed below.</p>

<h2>API Ideas</h2>
<p>Wikipedia API - for information on the members.</p>
<p>Google Maps API - to visually present where they're from or were founded.</p>
<p>SongKick API - I have applied for SongKick API and if I get accepted I'll use it to present various tourdates on the page.</p>
<p>Email API - I'll use this to create a report website fault form to and administator of the website.</p>
<p>Spotify API - I could have a page with there latest songs allowing you to stream as much as permitted from the site.</p>
