<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>This is my Seond major project for my full stack development course with the code institute. I am planning on creating a fan page for one of my favourite bands. The reason I chose to do this is I will be interested and intvested in this topic and I believe I can make it work.</p>

<h2>Intitial Ideas</h2>

<p>To start with I had to think how I could implement my new found skills into this project to test me. I will start by building a basic layout for the pages with HTML and CSS. I will only use CSS for static styling on this project and leave the animations and interactive styling to the javascript to process. </p> 
<p>I have thought about various different API's that work with this Idea and the ones I have come up with so far are going to be listed below.</p>

<h2>API Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia API - for information on the members.</li>
<li>Google Maps API - to visually present where they're from or were founded.</li>
<li>SongKick API - I have applied for SongKick API and if I get accepted I'll use it to present various tourdates on the page.</li>
<li>Email API - I'll use this to create a report website fault form to and administator of the website.</li>
<li>Spotify API - I could have a page with there latest songs allowing you to stream as much as permitted from the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the API's above I should be able to pull a lot of information to my website and successfully demonstate my ability with JSON</p>

<h2>Planning Stage</h2>
<p>I have started messing around with designs on balsamiq so I can get a starting picture of what to work with. I have only done 2 pages so far and I am planning on doing one for each page</p>
<p>From this stage I have come to the conclusion that this webiste will probably consist of 9-10 pages I'll break them down now.</p>

<h3>Website pages</h3>

<ul>
<li>Home page - Pretty landing page to catch the attention of the vistors</li>
<li>Store page - A with albums and possibly other items which when clicked will take you to a site where you can buy them</li>
<li>About page - This page will consist of 5 images and a bit of text explaining the page. the 5 images will be links the four band members separate pages as well as page for the band overall. </li>
<li>Tour Dates page - If i get an API key for this I will make a page that pulls all the bands upcoming tours and locations</li>
<li>Report issue Page - I will create a report issue form where it will send an email to my address. The link for this page will be located in the footer of the website</li>
</ul>
